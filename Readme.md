The device starts by pressing and holding the power button. After it powers up, it goes on to initialize the peripherals like flash system storage, pin assignment, and direction, the accelerometer, the display, analog to digital converter, and Real real-time chip. These settings are done once immediately after powering up.
The program then proceeds to check the battery level using its analog-to-digital converter. If the battery level measured is less than 10% of its capacity, it shuts down and puts the system into deep sleep mode, else it continues to take measurements from the accelerometer.
The data received from the accelerometer can show when someone taps the device, or walking, suddenly falls, or is idle. If there is a tap in idle mode, it just goes on the enable to display to come on after which it goes off after 20 seconds. When it is in walk mode, it automatically begins to count the number of steps and display it on the screen. It also keeps track of how long the device is in idle mode. The information can be vital for making decisions on the health of the user.
Also pressing the button when the system is powered up puts the system in a menu mode; the menus involved are setup mode, upload, and power off. By tapping the device in menu mode, you can move from one menu to another, and then use the button to select which menu is on display.
Finally, the system is programmed to upload data to the Thingspeak server every midnight.
